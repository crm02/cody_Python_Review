#Pet Class 
#Write a class named Pet, which should have the following data attributes:
#__name (for the name of a pet)
#__ animal_type (for the type of animal that a pet is)
#_ _age (for the pet’s age)
#The Pet class should have an _ _ init_ _ method that creates these attributes. It should also
#have the following methods:
#• set_name
#This method assigns a value to the _ _name field.
#• set_animal_type
#This method assigns a value to the _ _animal_type field.
#• set_age
#This method assigns a value to the _ _age field.
#• get_name
#This method returns the value of the _ _ name field.
#• get_animal_type
#This method returns the value of the _ _animal_type field.
#• get_age
#This method returns the value of the _ _age field.
#Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and
#prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be
#tored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s
#name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.
