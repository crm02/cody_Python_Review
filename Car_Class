#2. Car Class
#Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:
#• _ _year_model (for the car’s year model)
#• _ _make (for the make of the car)
#• _ _speed (for the car’s current speed)
#The Car class should have an _ _init_ _ method that accepts the car’s year model and
#make as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object’s _ _year_model and
#_ _make data attributes. It should also assign 0 to the _ _speed data attribute.
#The class should also have the following methods:
#• accelerate
#The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#• brake
#The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#• get_speed
#The get_speed method should return the current speed.
#Next, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five
#times. After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and dis-
#play it. Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the
#current speed of the car and display it.
